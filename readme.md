Chat Charger is not working for you.
<br>

## installation instructions

1. Drag the **Chat Charger** link above to your bookmarks bar.
  * NOTE: Don't click the link. That does nothing. Drag it.
  * If that doesn't make sense, watch this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E6h7Z5fPlg) that demonstrates the dragging process.
1. Open Farmville.
1. Click the **Chat Charger** bookmark in your bookmarks bar.
1. Super Tall Chat yay!


## details
Chat Charger gets rid of the game recommendations and makes the
Live Chat window taller.

Magic or Dangerous? No. The bookmark you click
changes two display properties. If you're
concerned, have a computer friend review the technical details
section below.

If you have suggestions for improving these instructions or adding
a new feature, please let me know at:
[ChatCharger@gmail.com](mailto:ChatCharger@gmail.com).

Chat Charger cannot change the function of the Live Chat
window, but it could change display options like fonts, colors,
text sizes.

## not happy?

If Chat Charger doesn't work or you don't like it:

* The effects of Chat Charger are erased every time you reload the Farmville page or restart your browser. Chat Charger has no effect unless you click the bookmark.
* Remove the bookmark from your bookmarks bar. Right click on the
**Chat Charger** bookmark in your bookmark bar, then choose Delete.
* Refresh your browser page to get a fresh copy.

Has **Chat Charger** stopped working? It's possible that Facebook has
changed something. Please
[let me know](mailto:ChatCharger@gmail.com)
and maybe I can fix it.

## technical details

This browser bookmarklet inserts two CSS rules into the page:

* Hide the game recommendation section at the top of the right column.
* Change the size of the Live Chat window to take up most of the
right column.

The CSS declarations use these class names from the page:

* .3ss (game recommendations)
* .uiScrollableAreaWrap (Live Chat)

The code in the bookmarklet is structured to make it as easy as
possible for a novice to understand (and change?). Most will not
change the bookmarklet but it is important to be as transparent
as possible regarding the actions taken since the user is trusting
the button to do stuff on their computer.

This bookmarklet is designed for the Farmville game page.
Please don't use it on other pages. If you do so by
accident, reload the page and all effects of the
bookmarklet will be banished.

## code
You can edit the bookmark before you use it and inspect its contents
to see that it doesn't do anything nefarious. You'll want
copy the code to a code editor for reformatting to make it easier
to read. Right click on the Chat Charger bookmark in your bookmark bar
and click "Edit" to see the code. Most browsers display the code with the label "URL".

I've included a formatted copy of the code below.

```javascript
var styleElement = document.createElement('style');
document.head.appendChild(styleElement);
var styleSheet = styleElement.sheet;

<!-- Remove the game recommendation sections. -->
styleSheet.insertRule(
  '._3ss {display: none;}'
  );

<!-- Make the Live Chat window taller. -->
styleSheet.insertRule(
  '.uiScrollableAreaWrap { max-height: 540px !important; }'
  );
```
